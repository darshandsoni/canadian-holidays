  "Canadian federal holidays observed nationwide.

Holidays are expressed with the syntax described by the documentation for
`calendar-holidays', and can be made to appear in the emacs calendar by
adding this list to `holiday-local-holidays' or `holiday-other-holidays'.

If the goal is to make these holidays appear in your org-mode agenda view
please consult the documentation for `org-agenda-include-diary' (it should
be set to `t') and also the Info node `(org)Weekly/daily agenda'.

(NB. if you try to use the %%(org-calendar-holiday) form in an org-mode
file to display holidays with the performance bump it promises, it seems
that some `holiday-float' entries like Victoria Day will not appear, for
reasons I do not currently understand.)

cf. also the province/territory specific holidays in each of:

  `holiday-canadian--ab'
  `holiday-canadian--bc'
  `holiday-canadian--mb'
  `holiday-canadian--nb'
  `holiday-canadian--nl'
  `holiday-canadian--ns'
  `holiday-canadian--nt'
  `holiday-canadian--nu'
  `holiday-canadian--on'
  `holiday-canadian--pe'
  `holiday-canadian--qc'

;; FIXME: there has to be a more idiomatic, less stringy way of
;; expressing this kind of table processing.  In particular I would
;; like to get rid of seq-do because I think that makes this very
;; simple code require emacs 25 or later, which seems unnecessary.

;; FIXME: also add a single customizable variable which can either be
;; a two-letter province/territory code or a list of such codes which
;; adds all those holidays to the calendar, to save users from having
;; to perform a bunch of list manipulation in their init file.
